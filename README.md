Harnessing Bayesian Ingenuity for Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
# BayesClassifier for Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project involves developing a BayesClassifier in Python to analyze movie reviews. It includes training the classifier on review datasets, tokenizing text, and using Bayesian probability to predict review sentiments.

## Project Structure
- `a4_yourname.py`: Main Python script for the classifier.
- `movie_reviews_small`: Folder containing a smaller set of movie review text files.
- `movie_reviews`: Folder containing a larger set of review text files.

## Features
- Tokenization of text reviews.
- Frequency dictionaries for positive and negative word frequencies.
- Methods for training, saving, and loading the classifier.
- Functions to calculate word likelihoods and make sentiment predictions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
Clone the repository and ensure the structure is as follows:
- Main script: `a4_yourname.py`
- Review datasets in `movie_reviews_small` and `movie_reviews`.

### Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python a4_yourname.py
